## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip
- Virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd lostandfound
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create .env file with:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

5. Run migrations
```bash
py manage.py migrate
```

6. Create superuser
```bash
py manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. Run development server
```bash
py manage.py runserver
```

8. Open browser to http://localhost:8000

### Running on Network (Access from Other Devices)

To allow access from other devices on your local network:

1. Find your computer's local IP address:
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt and run `ipconfig`
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   - **Mac/Linux**: Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr`

2. Run the development server on all network interfaces:
```bash
py manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

3. Access the application from other devices:
   - On the same computer: http://localhost:8000
   - From other devices on the network: http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000
   - Example: http://192.168.1.100:8000

4. **Important Security Notes:**
   - The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting is configured to accept all hosts (`['*']`) for development
   - For production deployment, update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` to include only your specific domain/IP
   - Ensure your firewall allows incoming connections on port 8000
   - This setup is for development/testing only - use a proper web server (like Gunicorn + Nginx) for production
