## PAGE 3: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Application Structure

**Three-Tier Django Architecture**

1. **Accounts App** - User Management Layer
   - CustomUser model (extends AbstractUser)
   - StudentProfile model (one-to-one with user)
   - TeacherProfile model (one-to-one with user)
   - Authentication views (login, registration)
   - Role-based profile creation

2. **Items App** - Core Functionality Layer
   - Item model with status tracking
   - Item submission, editing, deletion
   - Search and filter views
   - Category management
   - Photo upload handling
   - User-specific item dashboards

3. **Claims App** - Verification & Processing Layer
   - Claim model with workflow states
   - Claim submission and tracking
   - Admin review interface
   - Status update automation
   - Timestamp and audit tracking

### Data Model Relationships

**User → Items** (One-to-Many)
- Users can submit multiple items
- ForeignKey: Item.submitted_by → CustomUser
- Cascade deletion (if user deleted, their items are removed)

**User → Claims** (One-to-Many)
- Users can submit multiple claims
- ForeignKey: Claim.claimant → CustomUser
- Cascade deletion protection

**Item → Claims** (One-to-Many)
- Each item can have multiple claims
- ForeignKey: Claim.item → Item
- Related name: item.claims

**User → Reviewed Claims** (One-to-Many)
- Staff members review claims
- ForeignKey: Claim.reviewed_by → CustomUser
- SET_NULL on deletion (preserves claim history)

### Request Flow Architecture

**User Request Flow:**
1. User accesses URL → Django URL dispatcher
2. URL patterns route to appropriate view function
3. View queries database via Django ORM
4. Business logic processes data
5. View renders template with context
6. HTML response returned to browser

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Login request → AuthenticationMiddleware
2. Credentials validated against CustomUser
3. Session created and stored
4. @login_required decorator checks session
5. Permission checks for staff-only views
6. Authorized access granted or denied

**Claim Processing Flow:**
1. User submits claim form → ClaimForm validation
2. Duplicate check prevents multiple pending claims
3. Claim saved with "pending" status
4. Admin filters claims by status
5. Admin reviews and updates claim (approve/reject/complete)
6. Item status automatically updated
7. Timestamps and reviewer recorded
8. User notified via messages framework

```

### Security Architecture

**Multi-Layer Security:**
- Middleware: CSRF, XFrame, Session, Authentication
- View-level: @login_required decorators, staff checks
- Model-level: Custom user model with role types
- Form-level: Django form validation
- Database-level: ORM prevents SQL injection

**Access Control Matrix:**
- Students: Submit items, submit claims, view own data
- Teachers: Same as students + view all items
- Staff/Admin: Full access + claim review + user management

### Scalability Design

**Database Flexibility:**
- Currently: SQLite3 (development)
- Production-ready: psycopg2 included for PostgreSQL migration
- ORM abstraction allows seamless database switching

**Static Files:**
- ManifestStaticFilesStorage for cache busting
- Separate static and media directories
- Collectstatic for CDN deployment

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Database indexing on created_at fields
- Related name queries for efficient JOINs
- ForeignKey relationships with select_related potential
- Timestamp-based ordering for quick retrieval
